          <h2>Why Rowing?</h2>
          <h3>Rowing is the best sport of the water.</h3>
          <p>
            Rowing is considered a premier, "total-body" sport because it
            engages 86% of muscles in a single, low-impact stroke, combining
            intense cardiovascular endurance with significant strength training.
            It burns high calories (up to 600+/hour), builds a powerful core and
            posterior chain, and is suitable for all ages due to its
            joint-friendly nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rowing is often described as an "anabolic" or muscle-retaining
            sport, often resulting in high-level, long-term health, as noted in
            studies of athletes in their 60s to 90s.
